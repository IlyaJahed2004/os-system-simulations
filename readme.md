# OS Concepts in Practice

This repository contains a set of practical exercises designed to implement and simulate core Operating System concepts. The purpose of this work is to provide hands-on experience with OS fundamentals and to analyze system behavior in realistic scenarios.

> **Note:** The structure and template of this repository were originally provided by course instructors as guidance. However, all implementations, analyses, and simulations have been developed independently, showcasing practical understanding and coding skills. This does not reduce the portfolio value, as the emphasis is on the implementation, problem-solving, and system-level thinking.

## Project Goals
- Gain practical understanding of key OS concepts
- Implement algorithms and data structures related to process and memory management
- Analyze system behavior through code-based simulations
- Prepare for technical interviews and real-world projects in system programming and software engineering
