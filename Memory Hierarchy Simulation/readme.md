# Phase 1 — L1 Cache Only

## Goal
Implement L1 cache lookup and basic statistics (L1 hits, L1 misses) using the provided template.

## What this phase includes
- Direct-mapped L1 cache lookup (index = address % CACHE_L1_SIZE).
- Update L1 hit/miss counters.
- Account L1 access time for each access.
- Keep the rest of the memory hierarchy untouched for now.


## Next steps
- Add L2 cache lookup and integration.
